current issues:

When login in we're not setting up the user in the store

when we are in dashboard/register and then copy and paste dashboard/home it lets us go there, need to create a check
to bounce us back


NOTES ABOUT REACT-ROUTER
If you want to use router props, the interface for the component needs
to extend RouteComponentProps<any> example can be seen in

#loginContainer
dispatch: loginUser => logInUser();
    loginUser calls url/login
    recieves a token
    setsAuth with that token
    calls setEmployerAndUser

#userDashboardContainer
dispatch: submitEmployerRegistration
    calls url/employer/register
    sets auth with response.data.token
    dispatches setEmployerAndUser
